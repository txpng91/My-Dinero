A full stack personal finance web application, currently in development, set to perform the following:

-View all transactions on the transactions page with pagination for every ten transactions
-Search, sort, and filter transactions
-Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) budgets and saving jars
-View the latest three transactions for each budget category created
-View progress towards each pot
-Add money to and withdraw money from saving jars
-View recurring bills and the status of each for the current month
-Search and sort recurring bills
-Receive validation messages if required form fields aren't completed
-Navigate the whole app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
-View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
